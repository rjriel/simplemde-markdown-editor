# simplemde-iframe

A fork of the [simplemde-markdown-editor](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/simplemde-markdown-editor) repo that uses the marked-iframe library for iframe support.

To use in markdown type the following:

    /i/<src attribute>

For example:

    /i/https://www.youtube.com/embed/0fKg7e37bQE


This is a block level markdown, not an inline markdown.
